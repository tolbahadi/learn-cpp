# Learn C++

Rebooting modern C++ skills to contribute beyond the UI stack and collaborate on the team’s back-end systems.

## Focus Areas
- Idiomatic C++20/23: RAII, value semantics, smart pointers, STL containers/algorithms
- Tooling confidence: build systems, sanitizers, debuggers, profiling basics
- Ownership & interfaces: clean module boundaries, ABI awareness, integration with existing services

## Practice Archive
- 2025-09-20 — *A Tour of C++* ch. 1–4 (quiz, short answers, temperature-stats exercise): `practice/2025-09-20-cpp-tour-1-4/`

## Learning Resources
- *A Tour of C++* (2nd ed., Stroustrup)
- *Effective Modern C++* (Scott Meyers)

## Next Steps
- Continue chapter-by-chapter practice sets under `practice/` with timestamps
- Add notes on team-specific build/debug flows as knowledge solidifies
- Expand into templates, ranges, concurrency, and hygiene (linters, sanitizers)

Stay focused, keep the reps consistent, and review with the team to turn practice into production impact.
