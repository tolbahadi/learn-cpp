# Practice Summary — September 20, 2025

## Context
Review and applied practice for *A Tour of C++* (2nd ed.) Chapters 1–4. Focused on reactivating core language knowledge for modern C++ development after a long hiatus.

## Activities Completed
- **Multiple-choice quiz** (`quiz.md`): Checked retention of initialization forms, ownership models, scoped enums, STL containers, and algorithm usage. Only miss was on `std::array`, noted for follow-up.
- **Short-answer drill** (`short-answers.md`): Reinforced understanding of brace initialization, smart-pointer ownership, `enum class` benefits, `constexpr` use cases, and range-based loops.
- **Coding exercise** (`temperature-stats.cpp`, `main.cpp`): Built an interactive temperature statistics tool practicing token parsing, validation, exception handling, STL algorithms (`std::nth_element`, `std::minmax_element`), and separation of interface/implementation via headers (`temperature-stats.h`). Supporting prompt captured in `temperature-stats.md`.

## Content Emphasized (Ch. 1–4)
- Core type system: references vs. pointers, brace initialization, `constexpr`, and type aliases.
- Memory management and ownership idioms: RAII, smart pointers, and avoiding raw `new`/`delete`.
- Enumerations and strong typing with `enum class`.
- STL containers (`std::vector`, `std::array`) and algorithms for iteration, transforms, and statistics.
- Basic exception safety and error reporting patterns.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Revisit `std::array` and other Chapter 5 concepts once covered; update quiz notes accordingly.
2. Extend the temperature stats tool with unit conversion (C/F), `std::optional` returns, or ranges-based pipelines.
3. Schedule another quiz/coding session when progressing to Chapters 5–8 to cement templates, containers, and concurrency foundations.
4. Document team-specific build tooling (cmake, sanitizers) alongside these exercises for quicker onboarding.

## Running the Exercise
Compile and run from this directory:
```
g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic temperature-stats.cpp main.cpp -o temperature-stats
./temperature-stats
```
